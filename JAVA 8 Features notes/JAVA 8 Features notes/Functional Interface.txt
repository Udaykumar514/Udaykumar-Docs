Java 8 Features Example of Functional Interfaces : 

Functional Interfaces : 
=======================
If an interface contains only "one abstract method", such type of interface is called functional interface 
and the contained method is called functional method or single abstract method (SAM).
Functional interfaces provide target types for lambda expressions and method references. 
One separate package java.util.Function has been introduced for Functional Interfaces.


Examples of Functional Interfaces:
=====================================
Runnable : contains only run() method
Comparable : contains only compareTo() method
ActionListener : contains only actionPerformed()
Callable : contains only call() method 

How to write a Functional Interface : 
========================================
In addition to having only one abstract method, we must write "@Functional Interface annotation" 
to specify that the interface is a Functional Interface. If you add annotation @Functional Interface, 
compiler will not let you add any other abstract method inside it.

Example
========
//This is a Functional Interface
@FunctionalInterface  
interface FunctionalInterface1 {
		
	public void m1();

}


//This is not a Functional Interface. This code will show compilation error
@FunctionalInterface  
interface NonFunctionalInterface2 {
		
	public void m1();
	public void m2();

}
